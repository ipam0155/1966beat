<h3>The Beatles - Rain</h3>

<hr class="valighn"/>

<p class="main">"Rain" is a song that was released on May 30th, 1966 as the B-side of their "Paperback Writer" single. Both songs were recorded during the sessions for Revolver, although neither appear on that album. "Rain" was written by John Lennon and credited to Lennon–McCartney. He described its meaning as "about people moaning about the weather all the time".</p>
<p class="main"> The song's recording contains a slowed-down rhythm track, a droning bass line and backwards vocals. Its release marked the first time that reversed sounds appeared in a pop song, although the Beatles used the same technique on the Revolver track "Tomorrow Never Knows", recorded days earlier. Ringo Starr considered "Rain" his best recorded drum performance. Three promotional films were created for the song that are considered among the early precursors of music videos. Long before MTV.</p>
 
<h3>Music and Lyrics</h3>

<hr class="valighn"/>

<p class="main">The inspiration for "Rain" is agreed on by Neil Aspinall, the Beatles' roadie, and John Lennon. They both described the band's arrival in Sydney, Australia, marked by rain and poor weather. Lennon said, "I've never seen rain as hard as that, except in Tahiti", and later explained that "Rain" was "about people moaning about the weather all the time". Another interpretation is that the song's "rain" and "sun" are phenomena experienced during a benign LSD trip.</p>    
     
<h3>Recording</h3>

<hr class="valighn"/>

<p class="main">Recording began on April 14th, 1966, in the same session as "Paperback Writer", and concluded on April 16th, with a series of overdubs before mixing on the same day. At that time, the Beatles were enthusiastic about experimenting in the studio to achieve new sounds and effects. These experiments were showcased in their seventh album, Revolver. Geoff Emerick, who was the engineer for both sessions, described one technique he used to alter the sonic texture of the track by recording the backing track "faster than normal". When played back, slightly slower than the usual speed, "the music had a radically different tonal quality." The opposite technique was used to alter the tone of Lennon's lead vocal: it was recorded with the tape machine slowed down, making Lennon's voice sound higher when played back at normal speed.</p>    
<p class="main">The last verse of "Rain" includes backwards vocals, the first use of this technique on a record. <em>(The hit novelty song "They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa! ", where side B is side A played backwards, was released later that year of 1966).</em> The backwards vocals are Lennon singing the lyrics of the song: "When the sun shines", "Rain", and "If the rain comes, they run and hide their heads." Both Lennon and producer George Martin claimed credit for the idea. Lennon said:</p>    

<blockquote><p class="quote">After we'd done the session on that particular song – it ended at about four or five in the morning – I went home with a tape to see what else you could do with it. And I was sort of very stoned and tired, you know, not knowing what I was doing, and I just happened to put it on my own tape recorder and it came out backwards. And I liked it better. So that's how it happened.
</p></blockquote>    

<p class="main">Emerick confirmed Lennon's creative accident, but Martin remembered it differently:</p>
<blockquote><p class="quote">I was always playing around with tapes and I thought it might be fun to do something extra with John's voice. So I lifted a bit of his main vocal off the four-track, put it on another spool, turned it around and then slid it back and forth until it fitted. John was out at the time but when he came back he was amazed.</p></blockquote>    

<p class="main">Later, in 1980, Lennon claimed:</p>

<blockquote><p class="quote">I got home from the studio and I was stoned out of my mind on marijuana and, as I usually do, I listened to what I'd recorded that day. Somehow I got it on backwards and I sat there, transfixed, with the earphones on, with a big hash joint. I ran in the next day and said, 'I know what to do with it, I know ... Listen to this!' So I made them all play it backwards. The fade is me actually singing backwards with the guitars going backwards. [Singing backwards] Sharethsmnowthsmeaness ... [Laughter] That one was the gift of God, of Jah, actually, the god of marijuana, right? So Jah gave me that one.</p></blockquote>    
<p class="main">Regardless of who is credited for the technique, "from that point on," Emerick wrote, "almost every overdub we did on Revolver had to be tried backwards as well as forwards."</p>    
    
<p class="main">The tape segment in question featured John's lead vocal track in which he sang the song's opening line, along with the phrase "sun shines rain," which George had lifted from the second verse and the chorus. With the tape reel in hand, George overdubbed the thirty-second segment onto the tail end of the song.</p>

<p class="main">Martin's words about the Beatles' growing penchant for experimentation—"it was backwards forever after that"—would prove to be very prescient indeed. Harrison, for one, was ecstatic over the possibilities that backward recording entailed. With "Rain," "George Martin turned the master upside down and played it back. We were excited to hear what it sounded like, and it was magic—the backwards guitarist! The way the note sounded, because of the attack and the decay, was brilliant. We got very excited and started doing that on overdub. And then there was a bit of backwards singing as well, which came out sounding like Indian singing."</p>

<blockquote><p class="quote">Geoff later reported, tape manipulation very quickly became the norm for John, Paul, George, and Ringo. When they finished a new song, one of the Beatles inevitably said, "'Okay, that sounds great, now let's play it backwards or speeded up or slowed down.' They tried everything backwards," Geoff remembered, "just to see what things sounded like."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p class="quote">cutter Tony Clark was hardly surprised by the bandmates' newfound adoration for backward recordings. "It's because of the enveloping of sound," he later recalled. "It draws you in. It's like someone putting their arms around you."</p></blockquote>

<p class="main">the next session, a protracted, eleven-hour affair that was held in Studio 2 on Saturday, April 16th, Martin and the Beatles created further refinements to "Rain," including the addition of (ADT) short for (Automatic double-tracking) or (artificial double-tracking) to Lennon's vocal as recorded during take five. This resulted in an audible slowing down of his voice, as noted previously.</p>

<blockquote><p class="quote">to Geoff, "An offshoot of ADT was that we had a big audio oscillator to alter the frequency of the tape machines. We would drive it through a power amp and the power amp would drive the capstan wheel and enable you to speed up or slow down the machine at will. John—or George if it was his song—used to sit in the control room on mixes and actually play the oscillator."</p></blockquote>

<p class="main">In addition to the tape manipulation of John's voice, the day's session witnessed the superimposition of tambourine and backing vocals. And with that, the "Paperback Writer" backed with "Rain" single was complete. But after "Rain," the die had truly been cast: from henceforward, George and Geoff observed the Beatles clamoring for more and greater sonic effects, affording the producer and his gifted engineer with one new challenge after another.</p>

<p class="main">The "Paperback Writer" / "Rain" single was the first release to use a new device invented by the maintenance department at Abbey Road called "ATOC" short for "Automatic Transient Overload Control". The new device allowed the record to be cut at a louder volume, louder than any other single up to that time. On the final mix of the single they played the following instruments:</p> 

<div class="list1">
<ul class="b">
<li>Lennon played a 1965 Gretsch Nashville</li> 
<li>McCartney played a 1964 Rickenbacker 4001S bass</li> 
<li>Harrison played a 1964 Gibson SG</li> 
<li>Ringo Starr used Ludwig drums</li> 
</ul></div>

<h3>Promotional Films</h3>

<hr class="valighn"/>

<p class="main">The Beatles created three promotional films for "Rain" which are considered among the early precursors of music videos. These videos, along with other Beatles videos at the time, sparked George Harrison to say during the Beatles Anthology, "So I suppose, in a way, we invented MTV."</p>

<p class="main">The films were directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg who worked with them earlier on the pop 1960 television programme Ready Steady Go! One features the Beatles walking and singing in a garden and a greenhouse (filmed May 20th, 1966 at Chiswick House in London). The other two feature the band performing on a sound stage (filmed May 19th, 1966, one in colour for Ed Sullivan and the other in black and white for the UK). McCartney was injured in a moped accident on December 26th, 1965, six months prior to the filming of "Rain" and closeups in the film reveal a scarred lip and a chipped tooth. McCartney's appearance in the film played a role in the "Paul is dead" rumours from 1969.</p>

<p class="main">The Beatles' Anthology documentary video includes a re-edit of two of these three clips, full of rhythmic fast cuts and several shots that went unused in the original videos. This creates an impression that the videos were more technically complex, fast-paced, and innovative than was the case. For example, the backwards film effects shown here are 1990s creations. Such effects were actually first deployed in the "Strawberry Fields Forever" promotional film of January 1967. </p>
