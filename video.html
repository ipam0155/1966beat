  <h3>The Beatles - Rain (Custom edit)</h3>

  <hr class="valighn"/>

  <p class="main">So I wanted to test out a program called <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/" target="_blank">"Davinci Resolve 16"</a> It's a non-linear video editer (NLV). They offer two versions a free version, and a paid version. I ended up using the free version, which was fine for what I needed. 
  	I went on a website downloaded this beatles video "Rain". In 1966 they made three promotional films for the song. This one is the UK version which is harder to find. 
  	<p class="main">I then went into a browser and downloaded alot of still images from the same year (1966). 
  	I opened up a graphics editer (Photoshop) and edited all of the images, changed the "DPI", cropped them, and changed the resolution to match the video I was going to make, in this case 720x1080 (720p HD).</p> 
  	<p class="main">I finally opened up "Davinci Resolve" and started doing my own video edit. I ended up not liking the audio that was in the video I downloaded, so I ripped the audio off of a CD and replaced the audio with that one instead. I of course had alot of hit and miss to sync the audio and video after that, but it came out pretty good in the end. I then added all of the images and did some trasitions, key-frame animation etc, etc. As for the program, it's great I liked it alot better then "Adobe Premiere" which uses way more memory to use.</p> 
  	<p class="main">Anyways. Check it out!</p>
